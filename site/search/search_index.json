Jason was sent on a quest to obtain the Golden Fleece, to prove himself worthy as king - but the Colchian Dragon was the final obstacle (after many others) stopping Jason from obtaining the fleece. The colchian package contains the Colchian class, which can be used to validate .json documents, or rather the Python dict resulting from loading a .json file with json.load() . Colchian was developed with validation of .json configurations in mind, specifically those provided by the Conffu (https://pypi.org/project/conffu/) package, but will work for any reasonably sized .json or .yaml file (no testing was performed for large documents, nor has the code been optimised for performance). However, Colchian can be used to validate or correct any dictionary with mostly json-like structure and content. define validation rules in Python code, using a simple dictionary format validate and correct a dictionary, returning a new dictionary with the corrections applied raise exceptions if the dictionary cannot be corrected, with clear information on what the error is and where it occurs validate keys as well as values","title":"About"},{"location":"colchian/","text":"","title":"Colchian class"},{"location":"examples/","text":"","title":"Examples"},{"location":"getting_started/","text":"Getting started There are no requirements or dependencies for the package, but it is assumed you have dictionary-based data structures you want to validate. One easy way to get those is by using the standard library for loading json , or third party libraries for loading .yaml . Installation You can install Colchian from PyPI using pip like this: python -m pip install colchian If you already have Colchian installed and just need the latest version: python -m pip install colchian --upgrade Example of use There's a lot of documentation on the Colchian class , and a large set of examples to give a more complete overview of what's possible, but here's a simple example to get you started: ```python","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"There are no requirements or dependencies for the package, but it is assumed you have dictionary-based data structures you want to validate.
